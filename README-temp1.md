The US Environmental Protection Agency's mission is to protect human health and the environment. We develop models, tool, data sets, libraries, and applications to help serve our mission.

As part of the government's open source initiative, we publish software here and are open to recieving contributions depending on the project. Please see each repository's CONTRIBUTING.md file for how you can help.
